## Overview
BearMaps is an interactive web-mapping application for the greater Berkeley area. Along with my project partner, we developed the backend implementation written in Java and built off the ApacheMaven integration with IntelliJ IDE. Specifically, we used tile images and map feature data from OpenStreetMap to develop a rastered map using an underlying graph data structure, a routing feature based on the A* search algorithm, and a search bar feature with autocomplete. We focused on writing clean, object-oriented code and debugged using IntelliJ's built-in debugger and JUnit testing.
